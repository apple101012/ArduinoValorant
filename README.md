# Valorant Colobot Mouse Movement PATCHED!!!!!!!

A Python-based tool that simulates precise mouse movement to help automate targeting or movement behavior in a controlled environment. Inspired by Valorantâ€™s aiming mechanics and designed for educational and experimental purposes.

---

## Features

- Customizable mouse movement patterns
- High-precision timing and control
- Adjustable aim offsets, speed, and smoothness
- Toggleable activation (e.g. keyboard hotkey)
- Runs in the background with minimal resource usage

---

## Use Cases

- Simulated aim training bots
- Recoil control experiments
- Input automation prototypes
- Game AI behavior simulation

> **Note:** This tool is for educational use only. Do not use in live multiplayer games, especially competitive shooters like Valorant, as it may violate the terms of service.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pyautogui`
  - `pynput`
  - `time`, `math`
